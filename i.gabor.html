<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
<em>i.gabor</em> computes texture raster maps from a user-specified Gabor
filter bank and raster map.
The 2 dimensional Gabor filter is an orientation sensitive filter which mimics
the cells within the human visual cortex.

<p>
The default orientations computed will be 0 (East/West), 45
(North-East/South-West), 90 North/South, 135 (North-West/South-East).
However, the user can also specify any number of orientations in degrees less
than 180 with the <b>orientation</b> option.
The window size of the Gabor filter is specified by the user in
<em>i.gabor</em>
The standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel before it is oscilated is tied to
the user-specified window size.
<p>
The Gabor filter has both a real and imaginary component which can be used for
different purposes.
While <em>i.gabor</em> computes the real component by default, the imaginary
component can be computed by using the flag <b>-i</b>.

<p>
By default <em>i.gabor</em> outputs each Gabor filter convolved raster map as
individual raster maps with the prefix of <i>windowsize_orientation_wavelength_
offset_aspect</i> with each part corresponding to its specified value.
The <b>-c</b> flag can be used to create a singular combined raster map as the
output.
<p>
Additionally, <em>i.gabor</em> offers statistical thresholding which will set values below a
user-specified percentile (<b>threshold</b>) of the to 0 while keeping all
values above the percentile the same.
In conjunction with thresholding, a bitwise quantification (<b>-q</b>) method
is implemented for the orientations specified by the user.
<h2>NOTES</h2>

Common filter banks will consist of between 4 to 8 orientations and scales
controlled by the wavelength.
Each filter within a bank is subsequently convolved over the raster map and for
each kernel within the bank.
The resulting number of raster maps will be the number of orientations x the
number of scales.
The usage of a filter bank is what effectively models the visual cortex with
the multiple orientations and frequencies being evaluated individually to
create a low dimensional representation of a scene (Petkov, 1995)

<h3>Orientation quantification</h3>
The orientation quantificatation takes the index value (<i>i</i>) of each
user-specified orientation and applies <i>2<sup>i</sup></i> for every value greater than
or equal to the percentile value.
Where a bit string position is equal to one it indicates the corresponding
orientation<i><sub>i</sub></i> has a strong response.
<div class="code"><pre>
orientation = 0, 45, 90, 135
0   = 0b00000001 = 1
45  = 0b00000010 = 2
90  = 0b00000100 = 4
135 = 0b00001000 = 8
</pre></div>
This method will allow the values of the combined raster to be decomposed in
order to evaluate which orientations had high responses for a given raster cell.
I.e. if a cell has high responses at orientations 0 and 135 degrees, the
combined raster cell will have a final output value of 9, which as a binary
string is <i>0b00001001</i>.

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
<em>i.gabor</em> computes texture raster maps from a user-specified Gabor filter bank and raster map.
The 2 dimensional gator filter is an orientation sensitive filter which mimics the cells
within the human visual cortex.
</p>

<p>
The default orientations computed will be 0 (East/West), 45 (North-East/South-West), 90 North/South, 135 (North-West/South-East).
However, the user can also specify any number of orientations in degrees less than 180 with the <em>orientation</em> option.
The window size of the Gabor filter is specified by the user in <em>i.gabor</em>.
The standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel before it is oscilated is tied to the user-specified window size.
</p>
<p>
The Gabor filter has both a real and imaginary component which can be used for different purposes.
While <em>i.gabor</em> computes the real component by default, the imaginary component can be computed by using the flag <em>-i</em>.
</p>

<p>
By default <em>i.gabor</em> outputs each Gabor filter convolved raster map as individual raster maps with the prefix of <em>windowsize_orientation_wavelength_offset_aspect</em> with each part corresponding to its specified value.
The <em>-c</em> flag can be used to create a singular combined raster map as the output.
</p>
<p>
<em>i.gabor</em> offers statistical thresholding which will set values below a user-specified percentile of the to 0 while keeping all values above the percentile the same.
In conjunction with thresholding, a bitwise quantification method is implemented for the various orientations used.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Common filter banks will consist of between 4 to 8 orientations and scales controlled by the
wavelength.
Each filter within a bank is subsequently convolved over the raster map and for each kernel within the bank.
The resulting number of raster maps will be the number of orientations Ã— the number of scales.
The usage of a filter bank is what effectively models the visual cortex with the multiple orientations and frequencies being evaluated individually to create a low dimensional representation of a scene (Petkov, 1995)
